**`Digital Craftsman (Scientist/Reseacher/Developer)`**

I'm a Computer Scientist and Master's research student with a goal to revolutionalise the world of Artificial Intelligence. To bring my vision of AI to the mainstream, I set out on the journey to pursue further studies and become a didicated student of the field so that I can learn and master the tools and understanding required to make a lasting impact and have my work benefit both the academic and professional communities. My research areas and career focus align to Generative AI, Blockchain, and Cryptography where I use code as a scientific playground to creatively implement my ideas through experiments and come up with innovative ways to acheive greater innovation.

 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Shridhar's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey as a naive computer science student with a passion to learn everything I could about this world of computers - code, hardware, algorithms, etc. I have enrolled and been accepted into many programs, inluding the Android Associate Developers Program and the ALX Software Engineering Program. It is my passion to build programs and applications and watch them grow as my ideas expand. My desire to excel in Java and C# have led me to lead a team of developers to build a showcase project for my University that has been recognised professionally. I have a burning desire to experiment with technology and use it in ways to benefit me and hobby of computer hardware has allowed me to build multiple desktop computers, and two home & media servers using Plex and Linux respectively. I have a keen interest in the growing technologies of Artificial Intelligence and Automation in particular and have been teaching myself how to build these such systems. I have a dream to be a driving force of innovation in the world and one day and create programs and applications that have a lasting impression! To bring my vision to life, I decided to leave the professional world behind so that I can master the tools and understanding required to make an impact in the world - the world of computer science. I, however, cannot let my love for development die and try to find time to work on my own development projects to keep my skills sharp. This not only helps me stay on top of the languages I know but also gives me the opportunity to learn new programming languages and be exposed to more ideas for innovation.
